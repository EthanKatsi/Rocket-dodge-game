# rocket-dodge-game
Created and developed a Python code using pygame for a game where you're a space ship and you have to collect all the yellow squares (coins) without touching the red ones (enemies).
Once you collect all the yellow squares you move on to the next level where there is more red and yellow squares. It gets increasingly harder the higher level you are on and the levels are infinite.

All backgrounds and designs are created using Adobe Photoshop by myself, besides the UFO, alien, and coin sprite.

You can find the code in the file "SpaceDodgeGame".

Code created by Ethan Katsiroubas using Python.
