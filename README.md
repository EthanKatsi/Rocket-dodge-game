# square-dodge-game
Created and developed a Python code using pygame for a game where you're a rocket ship and you have to collect all the black squares without touching the red ones.
Once you collect all the black squares you move on to the next level where there is more red and black squares. It gets increasingly harder the higher level you are on and the levels are infinite.

Code created by Ethan Katsiroubas using Python.
