# square-dodge-game
Created a simple Python code using pygame for a game where you're a blue square and you have to collect all the black squares without touching the red ones.
Once you collect all the black squares you move on to the next level where there is more red and black squares. It gets increasingly harder the higher level you are on.

Code created by Ethan Katsiroubas using Python.
